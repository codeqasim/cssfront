## The goal of CSSFront Material 
Our goal is to build a set of high-quality UI components built with CSSFront and Material Concept.
These include foundational components and services, found in the SourceCode, and components that follow
the Material Design spec. These components serve as an example of how to build Awesome UI components
that follow best practices.

### What do we mean by "high-quality"?
* Internationalized and accessible so that all users can use them.
* Behave as expected across a wide variety of use-cases without bugs.
* Behavior is well-tested with both unit and integration tests.
* Customizable within the bounds of the Material Design specification.
* Performance cost is minimized.
* Code is clean and well-documented to serve as an example for developers.

## Browser and screen reader support
Material supports the most recent two versions of all major browsers:
Chrome (including Android), Firefox, Safari (including iOS), and IE11 / Edge.
